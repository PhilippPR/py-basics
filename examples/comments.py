# A Simple comment starts with a "#" and goes to the end of the line.
# Simple comments can be used to make a code easier to read. And to make yourself or others easier to understand your code.
# Simple comments are mostly used to even cut out a line in a code. For Example:
#print("dlroW olleH")
print("Hello World")

# Simple comments can even be used to cut a part of a line. The "#" cuts the line so the rest of the line is ignored. For Example:

print("Hello World") # This is getting ignored.
