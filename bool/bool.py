"""
Bool is a class that represents a boolean value.
Bool can be True or False.
The Bool value in Binary is 0 or 1 (0 = False, 1 = True)

By changing the value "ME" to True or False, you can change the value of the Bool.
In Python u have not to define the type of the value. True or False is enough.
If u want to be sure it is a Bool, u can use the bool() function. Like:
ME = bool(True) or ME = bool(False)
"""

ME = True

if ME == True:
    print("This is True")
if ME == False:
    print("This is False")
